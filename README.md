# Image Classification project: Real vs. AI-Generated Synthetic Images
## Project Overview

In this project, I built convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify images as either real or AI-generated. The implementation uses class-based Python coding to stream various tasks:

1) Sourcing images
2) Preprocessing images
3) Defining model architecture
4) Training & saving models
5) Evaluating models

## Methodology
The project uses hyperparameter tuning and model comparison techniques to enhance model performance. Different models were trained with slight variations in their configurations to identify the best hyperparameters.

## Running the Project
To execute the project, run the 'cifake-train-evaluate-models.ipynb' notebook. This notebook contains the necessary code to train and evaluate the models.
